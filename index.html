    <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            We as humanity produce incredible amounts of digital data. According to research conducted by International Data Corporation in 2018, it predicted that the Global Datasphere will grow from 33 Zettabytes (ZB) in 2018 to 175 ZB by 2025. This is a part of the progress that is impossible to revert. Another irreversible process is entropy: an all-consuming natural force that undermines systems and brings chaos and randomness. As a designer – person whose profession implies constant process and production of huge amounts of data – I feel the urgency of bringing up the problem of entropic forces and data pollution awareness among community. By questioning how creative field can find a way to work together with digital entropy instead of against it in order to fight data pollution I investigate particular cases of artists dealing with entropy in their works and look for advantages of it.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Data pollution refers to the presence of unwanted or inaccurate information in a data set. This can take many forms, such as errors in data entry, incorrect data storage, or incomplete data sets. Data pollution can also occur through other means, like bias or manipulation during data collection, or data breaches, among others. Data pollution can also be a problem for data preservation and archiving. When digital data is polluted, it can lead to data degradation and to the loss of important information or the inability to access old files. This can make it difficult or impossible to display and preserve works of art, design, and other digital media. Data pollution is a problem because it can lead to inaccuracies and poor decision-making based on the data. For example, if a data set contains a large number of errors, it can make it difficult or impossible to extract meaningful insights from the data. Inaccuracies can also skew the results of data analysis and cause false conclusions to be drawn.

            According to research conducted by IDC (International Data Corporation) in 2018, it predicted that the Global Datasphere will grow from 33 Zettabytes (ZB) in 2018 to 175 ZB by 2025. A zettabyte is a trillion gigabytes. Now multiply those 175 times. As of 2022 we have already produced and shared 94ZB of data. Taking into consideration that by the end of 2022 only about 70% of the world population has access to the Internet, and this percentage also keeps growing which suggests that in the future exponential growth of the amount of data produced and exchanged will accelerate even more. The issue with staying connected, making something fast, easily sharable, and accessible is an issue of the past decade. The new generation of designers would have to deal with the consequences of the tech boom in a face of an enormous amount of structured and unstructured data produced that nonetheless will be doomed to be eaten by entropy if not taken care of or properly archived.

            The bigger the amount of data, the more susceptible to entropy forces it will be. Entropy as a phenomenon can be found in various vast areas, from thermodynamics to computer science to human life, it affects all aspects of our daily lives while often staying hidden and neglected. However, in any given context entropy is essentially a measure of disorder, nature's tendency to eventually turn everything into chaos and decay. Already in the 19th century, Scottish physicist William Thomson and German physicist Rudolf Clausius developed the second law of thermodynamics which states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process; but it never decreases. With that law, scientists proved that entropy, chaos, randomness are simply unavoidable, an irreversible occurrence that could be fought against and slowed down, but never fully stopped from constantly increasing. Entropic processes undermine every known system, eventually turning it into chaos or dissolving it entirely, providing space for new systems to be built. The forces of entropy operate underneath the surface of the world, staying in the darkness, hidden, like an invisible to a human eye opponent and oppressor. Not even modern technology is immune to the forces of nature. As a society wishing to excel in various fields, for instance space exploration, we constantly need to fight off entropy in a face of a cosmic radiation. Cosmic radiation being one of the most common causes of technologies malfunction, it tends to flip bits. Just like radiation induces human DNA breaks, it also turns data 0s to 1s and via versa, making data corrupted and inaccessible. Remaining unobserved, these processes of digital entropy disturb system and render it unstable. In digital creative fields, such as graphic design, photography, and video, entropy can refer to the randomness or disorder of the bits that make up a digital file. Digital entropy could be seen in different areas, from data degradation to problems with data preservation and cryptography.

            Describing entropy as a destructive force that brings only chaos, we are used to seeing it as something negative that prevents us from building new systems and keeping existing ones in order. Although fundamentally different concepts, it is possible to draw parallel between Hindu goddess Kali which represents passage of time, destruction and rebirth and entropy as they both represent natural processes of change and transformation, the cycle of death and rebirth, and are seen as a symbols of the power of time and the inevitable passing of all things. Even though goddess Kali is often portrayed as fearsome dark destructive creature, it also seen as a mother figure. Perhaps adopting similar attitude towards entropy would help society treating entropy with a bit more understanding and question if we should really treat natural forces as an enemy. How can creative field find a way to work together with digital entropy instead of against it in order to fight data pollution?

        <h2>On data physicality</h2>
        <p>
            One important aspect of data is the fact that its existence is in a way invisible and therefore often worthless without a physical interpreter and/or carrier. While having not quite literal weight, data stays insubstantial due to lack of its literal physical form. We can’t see literal data, only computers interpretation of bits: 1s & 0s. We can’t feel its’ weight in our hands, only see how much space it takes on a carrier. We got so comfortable and lazy living in a digital realm, exchanging information of different sizes, from a couple of pages of PDFs of 100Mb to high-quality 3 hours movies of 80Gb, we are completely unaware and lack understanding of the physical aspect of it: how it travels through kilometers of fibers with (almost) the speed of light, or who’s owning hardware and data centers our data is resting at.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data storage is a much more complex aspect than we think. For many users’ the problem of digital storage stays hidden under the surface even though many of us must deal with it at some point. The discomfort of the necessity of dealing with the problem results in a fast solution such as simply buying more storage capacity, rather than staying with the trouble in order to have a better understanding of different aspects of the issue that would, perhaps, result in a profound understanding and a long-term solution. Yet again, instead of dealing with entropy, the user chooses to abandon the idea of personal physical data storage, instead in recent years the vast majority of users decided to let third parties take care of the storage matter, its management, and data safety. A new buzzword emerges – “Cloud”. The metaphorical aspect of the word “cloud” can often be misleading making the unaware user think of it as something lacking physicality, something “out there in the air”, something weightless, a magical space where data lives safely and can be easily retrieved at any time we want. Unlike the clouds we see in the sky, the storage cloud is very much possible to touch, or at least many things that make up the cloud. It is an entire industry with a hierarchy similar to that of feudal Europe where land is the complex infrastructure of physical hardware consisting of fiber optics, cables, satellites, and warehouses filled with computers.
